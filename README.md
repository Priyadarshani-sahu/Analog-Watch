This project is a simple yet elegant Analog Watch application developed using Java with the Swing GUI toolkit (JFrame). The watch mimics the functionality of 
a traditional analog clock with hour, minute, and second hands that move in real-time. The graphical components are drawn using Javaâ€™s Graphics and Timer classes to update the UI dynamically every second.

Key Features:
=======================
Real-time analog clock with smooth hand movement
Responsive UI using JPanel and JFrame
Efficient use of javax.swing.Timer for periodic updates

Technologies Used:
==================
Java SE
Swing (JFrame, JPanel)
Graphics API
